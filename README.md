# Adult-Day-Care-Center-Attendance
This is an application for marking the attendance of service users of an adult day care center.

In order to get this project to work you will need to have Visual Studio and when the project is 
opened several files are created to allow the program to store the .XML for service users and their 
attendance within the application.
