# Adult-Day-Care-Center-Attendance
This is an application for marking the attendance of service users of an adult day care center.

In order to get this project to work you will need to have Visual Studio and when the project is 
opened several files need to be created in order to allow the XML to be read and written correctly.

These are located within the Debug directory and are a folder called IO with two .XML files contained 
within called ServiceUser.XML and Mark.XML. I will need to figure out a way of creating these when the 
application starts as it already detects no information within files.
